### JS promises or Dart/Java/Kotlin Futures

Promises, something that daunts you for some time



#### what is the promise in real life ?

It has two outcomes , resolved ( or done ) and rejected ( or failed )

same case with promises

function SyncImages () {

  return new promise ((resolve,reject) => {
    
      a = 1+ 1;
      
      if(a==2) resolve( a + 'is resolved )
      else reject ( a + ' is rejected ')
    
  });

}



SyncImages().then( data => {
      console.log(data);
})
.catch( err =>{
      console.log(err);
})
