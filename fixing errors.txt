SOLVING MISSING TARGET AND NO RULE TO MAKE IT ERRORS

1. Figure out what the module is. You do this by taking what's between the "/" and "_intermediates".

2. Find out what module requires it, as this means that there is a shared library or dependency that you are missing. You can do this via mgrep after using build/envsetup.sh. Example:

mgrep "<modulenamefromstep1>"

3. Figure out what repo it is by using source from another ROM that you know works. Same thing as step 2 BUT you need to find the actual local module.

mgrep "LOCALMODULE := <modulenamefromstep_1>"

After that, add the repo to your dependencies or local manifest and try again.
